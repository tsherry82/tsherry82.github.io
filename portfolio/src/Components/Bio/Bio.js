                Thanks for checking out my portfolio, My name is Tim and I am a front-end developer originally from Orlando, FL. I recently graduated the UCF Coding Bootcamp where I learned skills in MongoDB,Express, React, Javascript and Node. I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for the same boot camp that I graduated from. In my spare time I enjoy going to the movies or playing video games.

                My goal is to find a position where I can utilize my new skills and continue to learn more as this industry continues to grow and evolve.
